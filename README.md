# Credit EDA Assignment - IITB
This case study intends to provide an example of how EDA might be used in a real-world corporate setting. Along with applying the skills we learned in the EDA module, we will gain a fundamental grasp of risk analytics in banking and financial services in this case study. We will also discover how data is utilised to reduce the risk of losing money when lending to consumers.
## Business Understanding
Due to the individuals' poor or nonexistent credit histories, lending providers find it difficult to grant loans to them. As a result, some customers take advantage of the situation by defaulting. Consider that you are employed by a consumer finance business that specialised in providing urban clients with different kinds of loans. EDA must be used to analyse the data patterns that are present. This will prevent loan applicants who can repay the loan from being turned down.

When an organisation receives a loan application, it must assess whether to approve the loan based on the applicant's profile. The bank's choice entails two categories of risks:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The data given below contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:

The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,

All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/company):

Approved:
The Company has approved loan Application

Cancelled:
The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.

Refused:
The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).

Unused offer:
Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.

## Business Objectives
In order to take steps like refusing the loan, lowering the loan amount, charging riskier applicants a higher interest rate, etc., the case study seeks to find trends that show whether a client has problems paying their installments. By doing this, it will be ensured that only borrowers who can repay the loan will be accepted. The objective of this case study is to identify such applications using EDA.

In other words, the organisation seeks to understand the characteristics that are reliable predictors of loan default, also known as the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default. This information can be used by the business in portfolio management and risk analysis.
